# AI System: Comprehensive Multi-Agent Architecture

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI system featuring multi-agent orchestration, kernel-level integration, sensor fusion, quantum-inspired speculative decoding, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system is designed for autonomous operation with high responsiveness and security.

## Architecture Components

- **Multi-Agent Core**: Centralized orchestration of specialized AI agents
- **Kernel-Level Integration**: Deep system control and monitoring
- **Sensor Fusion Layer**: Aggregation of data from various sensors
- **Quantum-Inspired Speculative Decoding**: Enhanced language model inference
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: External knowledge integration
- **AI Agents**: Specialized agents for triage, research, and orchestration
- **User Interface**: Voice and dashboard interfaces
